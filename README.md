## Overview

This project contains a simple and clean implementation of an NFT contract using Solidity. The contract is designed to be easily readable and modifiable, making it perfect for those who want to understand how NFTs work or want a starting point for their own NFT projects.

## Features

- ✅ 100% Solidity, no external dependencies
- ✅ Implements the ERC-721 (NFT) standard
- ✅ Simple minting functionality
- ✅ Easy to deploy and interact with
- ✅ Great for learning and prototyping

- **contracts/**: Contains the core smart contract(s) for the NFT.
- **scripts/**: (Optional) Scripts to help with deployment and interaction.
- **test/**: (Optional) Unit or integration tests for the contract(s).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for scripting and tooling)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for dependency management, if scripts are used)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (for smart contract development)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or another Ethereum wallet (for testing/interacting)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hiramabif/simple-nft.git
   cd simple-nft
   ```

2. (If scripts or packages are present)
   ```bash
   npm install
   # Or, for Foundry projects:
   forge install
   ```

### Compilation

If using Foundry:
```bash
forge build
```

If using Hardhat:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Deployment

**Using Foundry:**
```bash
forge create --rpc-url <YOUR_RPC_URL> --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> contracts/SimpleNFT.sol:SimpleNFT
```

**Using Remix:**
- Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Upload the contract file(s) from the `contracts/` folder
- Compile and deploy using the Remix UI

## Usage

Once deployed, use the minting function (commonly called `mint` or `safeMint`) to create new NFTs. You can interact with the contract through:

- Remix UI
- Scripting (using ethers.js, web3.js, Foundry scripts, etc.)
- Directly from your wallet, if it supports contract calls

### Example: Minting an NFT

Suppose your contract has a `mint(address to, string memory tokenURI)` function. You can mint an NFT by calling this function with the recipient's address and a URI pointing to the token's metadata.

## Smart Contract Details

- **Language:** Solidity
- **Standard:** ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Token)
- **Main contract:** Likely `SimpleNFT.sol` inside the `contracts/` directory

Typical functions:
- `mint(address to, string memory tokenURI)`: Mint a new NFT to the specified address
- `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the metadata URI of the specified token

Please refer to the actual contract file(s) in `contracts/` for the exact implementation.
